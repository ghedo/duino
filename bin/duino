duino - Command-line toolkit for working with Arduino boards

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 duino COMMAND [OPTIONS]

=over

=item List the supported Arduino models:

   $ duino models

=item Build a sketch:

   $ duino build --board uno

=item Upload the sketch to the Arduino:

   $ duino upload --board uno --port /dev/ttyACM0

=item Build and upload a given sketch file:

   $ duino build --board uno some_sketch.ino
   $ duino upload --board uno --port /dev/ttyACM0 some_sketch.ino

=item Upload a previously built hex file:

   $ duino upload --board uno some_file.hex

=item Communicate with the Arduino:

   $ duino com --port /dev/ttyACM0

=item Clean the build directory:

   $ duino clean --board uno

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<duino> is a command-line toolkit for working with Arduino boards that can
replace the Arduino IDE. It can be either used directly on the command-line or
integrated into third-party IDEs. With duino you can quickly build and upload
sketches to a variety of Arduino boards, and communicate with them using the
built-in serial monitor.

To work it needs the Arduino software environment that can be found on the
L<Arduino website|http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software>, or in most package
repositories (e.g. the C<arduino-core> package on Debian/Ubuntu).
